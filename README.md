# Mouse Highlighter

An extension for Google Chrome that highlights the mouse cursor so that it's a little easier to see when screen sharing.

## Installation

The open source version of this extension can be cloned from this github repo and installed from here. It's also available in the Chrome Web Store as /Mouse Highlighter/. I recommend you install it from there. If you want to install from source, do the following.

- Clone the repo
- Open Extensions (Menu, More Tools, Extensions) in Google Chrome
- Check the "Developer mode" checkbox
- Click "Load unpacked extension"
- Point it to the directory where you cloned the repo
